{"name":"2spark","tagline":"WIP Third part WP8.1 client for sparklr.me","body":"#Work in progress\r\nThis is a pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha project and we need code the 100% of the app\r\n\r\n#Sparklr on Windows Phone 8.1 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y5p2uwckle4pngiv?retina=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Marocco2/sparklrwp)\r\nIt is an upcoming client for the social network [Sparklr*](http://www.sparklr.me), which is currently in a closed beta phase. Although this app is created by a bunch of third-party-devs, we can say that we offer the first dedicated app for the growing social network.\r\n##Feature:\r\n- [ ] chat\r\n- [ ] posts, replies, images\r\n- [ ] friends\r\n- [ ] search\r\n- [ ] live tile, toast and raw notifications\r\n- [ ] users\r\n- [ ] tags\r\n- [ ] like/unlike\r\n- [ ] repost\r\n\r\n##How do I get it?\r\nThe app is currently under heavy development, so it's not available in the marketplace right now. We do however have a build server that offers snapshots. If you have an unlocked device, head over to \r\n###https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Marocco2/sparklrwp\r\nor\r\n###[Watch the releases :)](https://github.com/2spark/SparklrWP/releases)\r\n\r\nto download an highly unstable development build. As usual, we are not responsible for any lost data or damages to your device. Also, we can't be held liable if you're getting addicted to either the sparklr network or our app.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
